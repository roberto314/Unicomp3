parallel: install 6532, connect A4 to A2 (JP10 2-3) and /RS to +5V, PA7 is RX, PB0 is TX 
(straight Logic Level serial) - use double inverters 
to buffer and Level shift. Baud can be 4800 (also with 500kHz) or 9600 with patched image.
CONNECT PA0 to GND!!!! After Reset press Enter. CAPSLOCK must be on.
